# Infinite Relic - Investment Opportunity

**🔮 Real-World Asset Yield meets NFT Liquidity**

---

## Executive Summary

Infinite Relic is a revolutionary DeFi protocol that bridges traditional finance with blockchain technology. Users lock USDC to earn yield from real-world assets (US Treasury Bills) while maintaining liquidity through tradeable NFT positions.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Market Opportunity:** $2.5B+ in tokenized T-Bills (growing 300%/year)
- **Target APR:** 5-17% (significantly higher than traditional savings)
- **Revenue Model:** Dual streams (1% deposit fee + 10% performance fee)
- **Time to Market:** 6-8 weeks to mainnet launch

---

## The Problem

### Current Market Gaps

1. **Illiquid RWA Positions**
   - Traditional RWA platforms lock funds with no exit strategy
   - Users cannot access capital even in emergencies
   - Opportunity cost prevents adoption

2. **Complexity Barrier**
   - Existing solutions require KYC, whitelisting, minimum deposits
   - Poor UX drives users away
   - Technical barriers limit mass adoption

3. **Yield vs Liquidity Tradeoff**
   - DeFi: High liquidity but volatile/risky yields
   - TradFi: Stable yields but completely illiquid
   - **No middle ground exists**

---

## Our Solution

### The Infinite Relic Model

**Simple 3-Step Process:**
1. **Lock USDC** → Choose your lock period (30-365 days)
2. **Earn Yield** → Automatic investment in US T-Bills via Ondo Finance
3. **Trade Position** → Your lock is an ERC-721 NFT tradeable on OpenSea

### Revolutionary Features

#### 1. Liquidity Through NFTs
- Lock positions represented as tradeable NFTs
- Sell on secondary markets (OpenSea, Blur, etc.)
- Exit strategy without breaking your lock

#### 2. Tiered Yield System
- **30 days (Copper):** 5-7% APR
- **90 days (Silver):** 5-10% APR
- **180 days (Gold):** 5-13% APR
- **365 days (Infinite):** 5-17% APR

#### 3. No Lock on Yield
- Claim earned yield anytime
- No penalties for yield withdrawal
- Only principal is locked

#### 4. Performance-Based Fees
- 1% one-time deposit fee
- 10% fee only on yields >15% APR
- Aligned incentives: we profit when you profit

## Market Opportunity

### Total Addressable Market

**RWA Sector:**
- Current TVL: $2.5B (2024)
- Projected: $16T by 2030 (BCG estimate)
- **CAGR: 137%**

**DeFi Stablecoin Market:**
- $150B+ in stablecoin supply

### Competitive Analysis

| Platform | Liquidity | Min. Deposit | Yield | Our Advantage |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| **Ondo Finance** | No exit | $5,000 | 5% | ✅ NFT liquidity |
| **Maple Finance** | 90-day lock | $10,000 | 6-8% | ✅ Lower minimum |
| **TradFi (T-Bills)** | Maturity only | $1,000 | 5% | ✅ DeFi yields |
| **Infinite Relic** | ✅ NFT trading | $10 | 5-17% | 🏆 Best-in-class |

## Revenue Model

### Dual Revenue Streams

#### 1. Deposit Fees (Immediate)
- 1% fee on all USDC deposits
- Collected in USDC, immediately liquid
- Scales linearly with TVL

**Example:**
- $1M TVL → $10,000 immediate revenue
- $10M TVL → $100,000 immediate revenue

#### 2. Performance Fees (Recurring)
- 10% fee on yield above 15% APR threshold
- Only charged when users earn exceptional returns
- Incentive-aligned: higher yields = higher fees

**Example:**
- User deposits $10,000 at 18% APR for 1 year
- Earns $1,800 yield
- Above threshold: $1,800 - $1,500 = $300
- Our fee: $30 (10% of $300)

### Revenue Projections

| Metric | Month 3 | Month 6 | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| TVL | $250K | $1M | $5M | $25M |
| Unique Users | 500 | 2,000 | 10,000 | 50,000 |
| Deposit Fees | $2.5K | $10K | $50K | $250K |
| Performance Fees | $500 | $2K | $15K | $100K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$3K** | **$12K** | **$65K** | **$350K** |

**Conservative assumptions:**
- Avg deposit: $500
- 10% of yields exceed 15% threshold
- 50% user retention YoY
